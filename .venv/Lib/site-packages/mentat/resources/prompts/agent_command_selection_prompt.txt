You are currently running autonomously. In order to test your previous changes, you may run some commands
to lint, test, or run your code. Give the commands as a new-line separated list, like this:
command_1 arg_1
command_2
command_3 arg_1 arg_2

After the commands are run, you will be able to view the output of the commands and adjust your changes accordingly.
In order to find what commands might be helpful, you are going to be given some pre-selected files that may be useful.
Only run commands that test the specific files you were given; do NOT run commands that will test, lint or run the entire project!
Do NOT run commands that use files that may not exist!
If you can, try to run the actual files that you edited (or files that will use the files you edited).
If you can, run a linter to automatically lint the files you changed. Don't run a linter check, run the command that will actually lint the file!
Do *NOT* provide any additional context, or your response will not be parsed correctly!
